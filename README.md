### Get Started

To use this app for yourself, you'll need a server token for the Uber API.  Get that at https://developer.uber.com.

When you have obtained a server token, create a new file in `res/values` called `tokens.xml` (or something similar) and add your server token.  For example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="server_token">87ywef987y2r3iuohfwef23r2o9</string>
</resources>
```
